        <h2>Cloud Automation</h2>
        <p>Cloud automation involves using cloud management tools to achieve tasks without manual interference. Auto-provisioning servers, backing up data, or discovering and eliminating unused processes are some of the tasks that cloud automation could accomplish without real-time human interaction.</p>

    <div class="types">
        <h2>Types of cloud automation</h2>
        <img src="" alt="" id="image-right" >
        <li> <b>Configurations</b></li>
        <p> Infrastructure configurations can be defined through templates and code and implemented automatically. In the cloud, opportunities for integration increase with associated cloud services.</p>
        <li><b> Development and deployment</b></li>
        <p> Continuous software development relies upon automation for various steps, from code scans and version control to testing and deployment.</p>
        <li> <b> Tagging</b></li>
        <p> Assets can be tagged automatically based on specific criteria, context and conditions of operation.</p>

    <div class="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <img src="" alt="" id="image-left" >
        <li><b> Simplify Resource Management at Scale</b> 
        </li>
        <p > The cloud is a complex, distributed network of resources, from hardware to software, organized into nodes handling millions of incoming requests or powering data storage and retrieval flows 24/7. Configuring, testing, updating, and troubleshooting those resources is nearly impossible under normal working conditions, thus the benefit of automation in streamlining those operations.</p>
        <li><b> Govern Cloud Resources</b>
        </li>
        <p> While human ingenuity is always welcome and needed in cloud development when it comes to handling the minute tasks of cloud management, it’s more important to have governance baked into your infrastructure. Cloud management and automation can give you that governance, minimizing errors and allowing your engineers to focus on other things than worrying about what component might fail, or triggering a cost spiral.</p>
        <li><b> Improve Security Posture</b></li>
        <p> In regulated industries, security is non-negotiable. Furthermore, human error isn’t really an excuse for non-compliance. Automated systems can accurately support key compliance controls across an entire cloud environment using centralized policies.</p>

    <div class="Challenges">
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <li><b> Complex IT environments</b></li>
        <p> When the IT department deploys the service, that service might be deployed quickly and without any documentation. The team might not even properly script or refresh them for accurate application testing. 

            For example, app testing might require many instances of an operating system with changing components like databases. Since there are so many different system configurations, you can't guarantee that all the test systems will be taken down once testing is complete. And over time, handling these IT assets will become challenging. They will end up wasting resources that could have been provisioned anywhere. </p>
            <li><b> Lack of leadership or strategy in infrastructure building</b></li>
            <p>The IT infrastructure is the engine running behind all of the applications and data that empower a business. However, it's not visible to people who are not directly involved with it. 

                That's why the non-technical upper management and boards of directors might find the concept of automating it difficult. They have to understand the value of cloud infrastructure and what automation can bring for the company. If that's not the case, they might not be ready to agree with CIOs when asked for expensive automation solutions. These often compete with flashier projects like a new ERP system or investments in new tablets for the salesforce.  </p>

                <li><b> Upfront investment</b></li>
                <p> There's no denying that IT infrastructure automation comes with upfront investment. To make sure that automation brings organizations the results they seek, it's essential to first identify the areas where automation should be deployed and where it will bring quick wins (or the greatest return on investment). After starting a project like this, implementing automation elsewhere will become an easier task.</p>
